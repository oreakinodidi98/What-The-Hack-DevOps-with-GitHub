# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# In this example, @oreakinodidi98 owns any file in an Application  directory
# anywhere in your repository.
Application/ @oreakinodidi98

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
#*       @oreakinodidi98



# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only touches javascript files, only these owners
# will be requested to review.
#*.js    @octocat @github/js

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer.
